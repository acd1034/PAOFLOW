Calculating Rashba-Edelstein tensor elements for left handed tellurium.
The interpolated k-mesh should be made finer to achieve convergence.
To facilitate memory capacity of typical machines and ensure a reasonable runtime, in this example, the mesh is dramatically reduced.
For accurate results, choose k-meshes with the following specifications.
scf and nscf: 22 x 22 x 16
PAOFLOW interpolation: 200 x 200 x 180

main.py:
* Build the PAO Hamiltonian.
* Interpolate to a finer k-mesh.
* Compute the eigenvalues, gradient, and momenta.
* Compute the spin operator and spin texture in the user-defined energy window.
* Compute the adaptive smearing.
* Calculate the Rashba-Edelstein tensor, considering user-defined parameters like energy window, regularization, and two dimentional parameters.
