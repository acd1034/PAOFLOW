Compute the Hubbard U parameters for Magnesium and Oxygen in the compound MgO.
The ACBN0 routines are compatibile with QE v7.1 newer.

Initiate the workflow with the main.py script. Parallel options are set inside of this main.py script.
* main.py should always be run in serial, as it will spawn the mpi processes for QE and PAOFLOW runs

The workdir argument, provided to ACBN0 in main.py, specifies the working directory.
* Template files must be provided inside of the working directory, with names: prefix.scf.in, prefix.nscf.in, and prefix.projwfc.in. 'prefix' can be an arbitrary name, and is provided to ACBN0 through the main.py script

* Hubbard occupations and initial U values can be provided either in the input templates, or within the main script. Any information provided through the template will be superseded by calls to set_hubbard_parameters within the main.py script.

* All necessary pseudopotentials must be placed in the appropriate pseudo_dir directory

Other arguments allow control of mpi process spawning.
* Arguments for specifying independent mpi options for python and QE processes are named mpi_python and mpi_qe.
* The argument qe_options allows QE flags to be passed to pw.x
* The python_path and qe_path arguments can point to specific installations
